    <!--About Me-->

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class = "componentContent">
            I am a recent Computer Science Graduate from UCSD eager to begin my career. Although I am fairly new to the field
            I am always excited to learn new concepts and tools to better my skills. <br><br>

            From a young age, I had an interest in STEM because of video games and a creative side expressed through the arts and toys centered around building.
            I have always seen coding and developing to align with these interests because of how you can assemble these different functions, frameworks, algorithms, etc. 
            into essentially whatever you want.<br><br>

            Outside of tech, my hobbies are photography (portfolio site coming soon), fashion, and music.
